### Timer
I just created the timer on my own, based on past experiences

### Quote
The quote on the webpage is randomly generated from a pool of 16 quotes (RNG weight have been removed, starting from update **0.a2.02**). <br> 
RNG is created from [my fork](https://github.com/penny2k8/rng-js) of [rng-js](https://github.com/skeeto/rng-js/tree/master) by [skeeto](https://github.com/skeeto). <br>
If you want to contribute, you can DM me *your* quote so that I can add to the pool.
